    "Coding with the micro:bit encourages you to gain basic skills preparing you for today’s modern digital world. The BBC micro:bit integrates the code you write with the embedded hardware to create interesting projects, while teaching you how to control hardware through programming. This promotes an understanding within kids by demonstrating they have to program the hardware to respond to their code and input."
